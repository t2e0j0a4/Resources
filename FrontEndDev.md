## Technologies Involved 

-  **_HTML, CSS, Javascript_** are the main three pillars of _Web Development_. And there are  many Open-Source Frameworks and Plugins available for the development.
-  Frameworks helps developers with already custom built components to their code.
- There are some **_CSS_** frameworks  like : 
	* **Tailwind CSS** - This CSS Framework helps in providing _utility classes_ for your code where styling is needed. One of the key benefits of Tailwind is that it allows developers to build custom designs without having to write custom CSS.
	* **Bootstrap** - Bootstrap is a more feature-complete framework, with a larger set of predefined styles and UI components. And easier to build responsive layouts.
	
- And Javascript has many frameworks & libraries, but while learning Frontend we come across : 
	* **jQuery** - For DOM (Document-Object Model) Manipulations.
	* **React.js** - This JS Library often used for building Single-page applications and UI components can be reusable.
	* **Angular** - Like React, Angular is also a JS Framework for Single-page Apps and helps in creating reusable UI Components. It uses a template-based syntax.
	* **Vue.js** - Like React and Angular, Vue allows developers to create reusable UI components. It uses a template-based syntax, similar to Angular, which means that the UI is defined in HTML.
	and more...
	
**NOTE** : Choose one framework and try to learn about it maximum. Then if you're interested you can go with others too.

**NOTE :** Project-based learning is best learning. So, learn while doing projects. When you're starting you can take reference to others work. But later on try yourself and enhance yourself.

### <u>*Day 21-25*</u>
As of now you have some knowledge of HTML, CSS. Start building ***projects***. Initially you can take video references but later try to make your own projects and show case them with your fellow developers and take inputs from them and try to implement them by your next projects.

***Some HTML & CSS Projects Ideas:*** 
1. <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/">Web Design Certification - freecodecamp.org</a> - This is a completly free certification course. Here, you needed to build 5 projects each by learning them. Finally you will receive a certificate by completing 5 projects.
2. <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/">Frontendmentor.io</a> - Provides you complete design pack of the website you have to built. Try to convert design to your development code and submit to them.
3. Try to **clone some websites**, like :
	- A basic landing page: This could include a header, a hero image or banner, some sections to highlight features or products, and a footer. You could use HTML to structure the content and CSS to style it. 
	- A portfolio website: This could showcase your work and projects, and include an about section, a contact form, and links to your social media profiles. You could use HTML to structure the content and CSS to style it and add transitions and animations.
