## Technologies Involved 

-  **_HTML, CSS, Javascript_** are the main three pillars of _Web Development_. And there are  many Open-Source Frameworks and Plugins available for the development.
-  Frameworks helps developers with already custom built components to their code.
- There are some **_CSS_** frameworks  like : 
	* **Tailwind CSS** - This CSS Framework helps in providing _utility classes_ for your code where styling is needed. One of the key benefits of Tailwind is that it allows developers to build custom designs without having to write custom CSS.
	``` HTML
		<!-- Tailwind Utility class for text color black. -->
		<h1 class='text-black'>Hello World</h1>
	```
	* **Bootstrap** - Bootstrap is a more feature-complete framework, with a larger set of predefined styles and UI components. And easier to build responsive layouts.
	
- And Javascript has many frameworks & libraries, but while learning Frontend we come across : 
	* **jQuery** - For DOM (Document-Object Model) Manipulations.
	* **React.js** - This JS Library often used for building Single-page applications and UI components can be reusable.
	* **Angular** - Like React, Angular is also a JS Framework for Single-page Apps and helps in creating reusable UI Components. It uses a template-based syntax.
	* **Vue.js** - Like React and Angular, Vue allows developers to create reusable UI components. It uses a template-based syntax, similar to Angular, which means that the UI is defined in HTML.
	and more...
	
**NOTE** : Choose one framework and try to learn about it maximum. Then if you're interested you can go with others too.
