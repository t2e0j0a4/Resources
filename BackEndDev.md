**What is the difference between backend and frontend web development?**

Backend web development includes the server-side process of a website, such as the *server-side scripting and the database*. Backend developers are responsible for ensuring that a website functions properly and can handle the traffic and data being processed. Also interacting with databases to store and retrieve data used by the website.\
**AND**\
Frontend web development, on the other hand, refers to the development of the user-facing aspects of a website, such as the design and layout of the website and how users interact with it. Frontend developers work with languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the look and feel of a website.

## What Involved in learning Backend ?

Backend Roles are different and has no connection with Frontend Development. Yet if you want to become a full-stack web developer you definetly need basics of HTML, CSS, JS - <a href='https://github.com/e-DAMCommunity/Resources/blob/main/FrontEndDev.md'>Frontend Development Roadmap</a>

- How *Internet* works.
- Version Control System ( i.e, ***Git*** ) and how to host your local project repo.
- Learning a *server-side programming language*. Some popular options include Javascript, Python, Ruby, and Java.

### <u>*Day 3-20*</u>

***Learning a Programming Language***\
Learning a language when you are starting with Backend Web Development helps your website to function along with databases, frameworks, web servers etc...

You can choose any of the languages below mentioned : 
	1. ***Javascript*** ( *Preffered* - Because if you want to become a Full-stack Developer. You definetly need to learn Frontend Technologies that definetly includes Javascript . You can manage both client and server with single language.)
	2. ***PHP*** - (PHP is a popular programming language for web development. It is a server-side language, meaning that it is executed on the server and the results are sent to the user's web browser.)
	3. ***Python, Java, C#, Ruby, Go, Rust***.

### <u>*Day 21-23*</u>

***Version Control (Git)*** - Git is a version control system that is used to track changes to files, especially when multiple people are working on the same project. It allows developers to work on different parts of a project simultaneously, and then merge their changes back together. Git stores this information in a data structure called a repository.

***Github*** - GitHub is a web-based platform that is built on top of Git. It allows developers to store their projects in a remote repository, and share their work with others. GitHub also provides tools for collaboration, such as the ability to assign tasks, track issues, and review code. In addition, GitHub offers features such as a bug tracker, project management tools, and team communication tools.

\
\
**Should Know :**
- Commom and General Terminology used in Git and Github.
- How to merge your branches and updating main branch.
- Opening PR's (Pull Requests) for the Repo after you worked.

### <u>*Day 24-34*</u>

***Learn Web Framework*** - Backend web frameworks are tools that provide a set of libraries and functions that make it easier to build and run web applications. They provide a structure for developing web applications and help to handle the underlying technical details so that you can focus on building the features of your application.

**Popular Web Frameworks :**

- Node.js (Javascript)
- Django & Flask (Python)
- Laravel (PHP)
- Spring (Java)
- Rails (Ruby) and more...

**Must Know** : 

- Database management : Most backend web applications interact with a database and learn how to create and manage a database, as well as how to write queries to retrieve and manipulate data.
- Request handling : In a backend web application, the server receives requests from clients (usually web browsers) and sends back responses. You'll need to learn how to send appropiate request to particular request.
- Authentication and authorization : If your application involves user accounts, you'll need to learn how to implement authentication and authorization.

### <u>*Day 35-45*</u>

**Databases and CRUD Operations :**

*Database* - A database is a collection of data that is organized so that it can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. It is a crucial component of many web applications, as it allows the application to store and retrieve data efficiently.

*CRUD* - CRUD stands for ***"create, read, update, and delete,"*** and these are the four functions that a database should be able to perform.

**Create:** This operation is used to add new data to the database.\
**Read:** This operation is used to retrieve data from the database.\
**Update:** This operation is used to modify existing data in the database.\
**Delete:** This operation is used to remove data from the database.

*In a web application, these CRUD operations are typically implemented through a set of API (application programming interface) endpoints that allow the front-end to communicate with the back-end. The back-end will handle the requests from the front-end and perform the appropriate CRUD operation on the database.*

***NOTE :*** Many different types of databases that you can use for a web application, including relational databases (such as MySQL and PostgreSQL) and non-relational databases (such as MongoDB and Cassandra). The choice of database will depend on the needs of your application and the type of data you are storing.

Generally if you work in Javascript then we choose ***MERN*** ( MongoDB, Express, React.js, Node.js ) | ***MEAN*** ( MongoDB, Express, Angular, Nodejs ) | ***MEVN*** ( MongoDB, Express, Vue.js, Nodejs ) Stacks for developing Web Applications.

### <u>*Day 46-50*</u>

Here you have some knowledge of tech skills needed for building full-stack web apps. Try building some cool projects and show case them. And also try to host your applications in Web Hostings like <a href="https://heroku.com">Heroku</a>

**Project Ideas :**
-	A To-do List application that stores todo in database and try performing CRUD operations and build a User-interactive frontend.
-	A social media platform for connecting with friends and family. This project would involve building features for user authentication, creating and viewing profiles, sending and receiving friend requests, and posting and commenting on status updates.

**Remember :**\
This is just a drop in ocean there is much more to learn for becoming a full-stack developer.\
This is definetly time taking process to learn these many and don't be in hurry learning quickly. Understand first then try to execute.\
Have any doubts can reach us anytime.
